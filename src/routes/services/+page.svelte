    <h1>Our Services</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>At Inlet Sites we offer any web site services that you need from a simple one-page website up to custom software for businesses. This page will attempt to break down some of the services we offer and explain them in a non-technical way so that anybody can understand. Of course if you have any questions then we encourage you to reach out to us either to answer a quick question or to set up a free consultation.</p>

    <h2 id="businessCard">Business-Card Website</h2>
    <p> A business-card website is a simple website that displays the services and other information about the business. A website like this can display any information that is wanted and be customized to look exactly as needed, with any information necessary.</p> 

    <p>The difference between this and a custom solution, or an online store, is that a business-card website does not change, every user will view the exact same information. Alternatively, a dynamic/custom site, or online store will include data that can change, such as items in a store that can be changed/updated or user information.</p>

    <p>While business-card websites are static, they can, of course, be updated. If you would like to make changes to your website you may do so at any time. Any time that you want to change some information on your website, we are happy to do that for you. See <a href="/prices#businessCard">prices</a> for more information.</p>

    <p>As with all sites created by us, the website will work on desktop computers, phones, and everything in-between. We build all sites to work on all devices.</p>

    <h2 id="domain">Domain Purchasing</h2>
    <p>In order to host your website online, you need to have a domain. The domain is just the address of your website. For example "inletsites.com". Inlet Sites will assist you in finding/purchasing your domain at no additional cost.</p>

    <p>Domain costs are not covered in development due to the nature of their wildly variable prices, so the cost of the domain is billed to the client. Some can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars! However, usually you can find a good domain that costs under $50.</p>

    <p>The domain also costs money to mantain. It is a yearly cost and usually the same as the price to purchase it.</p>

    <p>You have the option of allowing Inlet Sites to purchase it for you and fully manage it. Or you can purchase it yourself and maintain it. Both options are free, but allowing Inlet Sites to manage it simplifies things. If purchased by Inlet Sites, you may request transfer to yourself at any time.</p>

    <h2 id="blog">Blog</h2>
    <p>A blog is an additional service that can be added on top of your website. There are two different options. Using the Inlet Sites portal to login/create your blogs, or creating a custom portal on your own website to create your blog posts.</p>

    <p>Any blogs that you create will always remain your property. If you decide to leave Inlet Sites, then we will provide all of the data for the blogs that you have created. We will never remove any content that you have created unless you specifically request it. In addition, you may request the data for your blogs at any time by simply contacting us.</p>

    <h3>-Inlet Sites portal</h3>
    <p>Using the Inlet Sites portal to create and publish your blogs is the simplest way to get started creating a blog to display on your website. There is no additional development cost other than the cost of the extra page(s) to display your posts. Generally, the blog posts on your site will only be charged as a single page, not a page for each blog post you create. You will not be charged the $100 development cost for each blog, it will just be charged as one page. If you need a page to also display all blog posts, then it will be considered two pages.</p>

    <p>With this option, if you should choose to take your website to another developer/organization for hosting, the method for creating your posts will not be able to be taken with you. Another developer would have to create a custom solution for their platform.</p>

    <h3>-Blog portal on your website</h3>
    <p>If you would like to have a portal for creating a blog on your own website then this can also be done. However, this will entail much more work, including a back-end to run on the server specifically for your site as well as setting up a database. Therefore this is a more expensive option. The benefit to this is that if you decide to take your website somewhere else to have another developer/organization host your site, then you can take the entire system with you.</p>

    <h2 id="gallery">Photo Gallery</h2>
    <p>Displaying images of your business on your website is a great way to give customers/clients a good feel for your business and to see what you have to offer. We can create a page on your website to display all of your photos on your own website. You can update add or remove any pictures that you want, at any time. Much like blogs, you can use the Inlet Sites portal to manage all of your images for a set price. Or, alternatively, you can have a custom portal for editing this built into your website for an extra cost.</p>

    <p>Due to the added cost of storage and serving of large numbers of images there is a monthly fee depending on the number of photos that you have in your gallery.</p>

    <p>To optimize the website loading speed and save storage space, the images that you upload will be optimized (compressed and likely shrunk in size). Large image sizes can greatly affect the loading speed of your site. Due to this, you should always keep the originals and not rely on Inlet Sites for image storage. If you need suggestions for online storage, we are happy to offer our advice and suggestions.</p>
    <h2 id="emailing">Emailing</h2>
    <p>When setting up a website, there can be multiple different things that you need in terms of email. You may need automated emailing, for example, to send emails confirmation for different actions, or contact forms. We can also set up email addresses from your domain.</p>

    <h3>-Personal email from your domain</h3>
    <p>If you have your own domain and would like to create an email address for yourself or others, then we can set that up for you. For example, if you own "my-business.com", we can create an email address: "your-name@my-business.com".</p>

    <h3>-Automated emailing</h3>
    <p>Sometimes you may need automated emailing set up for your site. We can create this for whatever you need, whether it is a contact form on your site, a confirmation email for signing up for a mailing list, or anything else that you might need.</p>

    <h3>-Email lists</h3>
    <p>If you would like to maintain a mailing list to send out emails, automated or otherwise, then this can easily be created for you to send out as many emails you need to as many people as you need.</p>

    <h2 id="hosting">Website Hosting</h2>
    <p>After a website has been created, you will also need to host it on a server to open it up to the internet. Inlet Sites can handle all of the hosting for the website so that you never have to worry about anything. Pricing for the hosting is paid monthly and is based on the complexity of the site that you need hosted.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, we cannot host sites created by other developers. The reason for this is the technical challenges in doing so. There are many different coding languages, frameworks, etc. that other developers may have used and we cannot guarantee time, price or quality of sites not developed here at Inlet Sites.</p>

    <p>However, if you would like to take your site developed at Inlet Sites to another developer/hosting service, then you may do so at any time with no cancellation fees.</p>

    <h2 id="paymentPlan">Payment Plans</h2>
    <p>Website development can be expensive, that is why we offered limited payment plans so that you may spread the payments out over the course of months, or even up to a few years. So long as you are receiving hosting services from us, you can spread the development costs over time. There are no extra fees for this, but hosting of the site is required until the development cost is paid off.</p>

    <h2 id="store">Online Stores</h2>
    <p>If you are looking to create a custom online store for your business then we can create that for you. The prices for this are negotiated case by case but we can handle any needs you have including a database of your products and online payments.</p>

    <h2 id="onlinePayment">Online Payments</h2>
    <p>If you need to accept payments on your website, then we can create a way to do this on your site. Whether this is part of an online store, or you want to offer a way for customers/clients to make payments on your site. We use Stripe to process payments, which incurs its own costs as well.</p>

    <h2 id="custom">Custom Business Software</h2>
    <p>Some businesses require more extensive websites with custom software. Examples of this could be a business that needs inventory management, a restaurant that wants seat management, or a restaurant that wants online ordering/management/payment. We can create all of this right on your own website for you. We know that each business is different and that is why we will personally work with you to create exactly what you need. Due to the differeing requirements for each business, we will assess costs and exactly what you need based on your requirements. Just set up a free consultation to discuss more about this.</p>
